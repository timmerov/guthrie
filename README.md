Implement Guthrie Voting in a simulated electorate.
Guthrie voting defined and evangelized here:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GL__lJMoX5Cku35h4BLXhJHQ_NxuzGaA5tN-OORVdmw/edit?tab=t.0

Loosely speaking, Guthrie voting is any system where:
1) Voters cast an anonymous ballot with a single vote for their favorite candidate.
2) if any candidate has a majority they win.
3) Otherwise, the candidates negotiate a winner by a set of formal rules where:
4) There are one or more rounds of negotiation.
5) Each round, candidates declare how they intend to vote.
6) Candidates may publicly change their votes.
7) A final tally is made and a winner is determined when there are no more changes, i.e. when a Nash equilibrium has been achieved.

For the most part, the set of formal rules for the contingent election doesnâ€™t matter too much.
The candidates will informally agree to unwritten rules that more/less follow Coombs' method.
Coombs' method is used in the code.

In Coombs's method, there are a series of voting rounds alternating between:
A) Voting for a majority winner.
If a candidate has a majority, they win.
B) Voting to eliminate a candidate from the ballot.
Eliminated candidates participate in subsequent rounds to choose the winner.
A candidate has voting power (asset) equal to the number of votes they got from the electorate.
