analyze guthrie voting.

assumptions:
1. voter engagement is limited.
they have enough capacity to pick their favorite candidate.
but that's it.
they don't have the time or energy or motivation to score or order candidates.
they are effectively stupid.
2. a candidate with a majority of the votes wins.
3. we want more than two parties.
4. third parties cannot split the vote.
5. protest votes should be safe.
6. voters should vote honestly.
7. candidates are not stupid.
they are informed, motivated, and have time and energy to fully engage the system.
they can score and order the other candidates.
8. candidates may vote strategically.
9. the winning candidate should maximize total satisfaction (utility) of the voters.
10. voters know how all the candidates score/rank each other.
11. candidates should not be harmed by getting more votes from voters.
independence of irrelevant alternatives and participation criteria.


guthrie voting works like this:

phase 1:
the primary reduces a large number of candidates to a manageable number.
but not less than 3.
we pick a number of primary candidates equal to the cube root of the number of voters.
voters cast a single vote for their favorite primary candidate.
excess candidates are removed by single transferable vote.
other culling methods are acceptable.

phase 2:
voters cast a single vote for their favorite candidate.
working example: A,B,D received 35,30,25,10 votes respectively.
A prefers B > C > D.
B prefers A > C > D.
C prefers D > B > A
D prefers C > B > A

phase 3:
find the winner by coombs method.
round 1:
A casts 35 votes for A.
B casts 30 votes for B.
C casts 25 votes for C.
D casts 10 votes for D.
totals: A=35, B=30, C=25, D=10.
no one has a majority.
proceed to the elimination phase.
A casts 35 votes against D.
B casts 30 votes against D.
C casts 25 votes against A.
D casts 10 votes against A.
totals: A=35, B=0, C=0, D=65.
D is eliminated from the ballot but not the voting.
round 2:
A casts 35 votes for A.
B casts 30 votes for B.
C casts 25 votes for C.
D casts 10 votes for C.
totals: A=35, B=30, C=35, D=0.
no one has a majority.
proceed to the elimination phase.
A casts 35 votes against C.
B casts 30 votes against C.
C casts 25 votes against A.
D casts 10 votes against A.
totals: A=35, B=0, C=65, D=0.
C is eliminated from the ballot but not the voting.
round 3;
A casts 35 votes for A.
B casts 30 votes for B.
C casts 25 votes for B.
D casts 10 votes for B.
totals: A=35, B=65, C=35, D=0.
B has a majority.
B wins the election.


there are several ways to model the electorate:
see electorate.h for details.

for single axis and uniform or random distribution...
either there's a majority.
or there's a condorcet winner.
we're in a nash equilibrium.
ie there's no incentive for either the voters or the candidates to change their votes.
ie to vote strategically instead of honestly.
an exception would be when a candidate's preference isn't honest.
example: A=40 B=35 C=25 where C for whatever reason prefers A>B.
then A+C eliminate B and A wins in round 2 with votes from B.
but if enough  voters can see this coming before the election,
they will also vote dishonestly for their second choice, B.
giving B a majority win in round 1.
so C's strategy for getting a victory for A would be to lie to their constituents.
and vote against their wishes.

ties are difficult to handle.
the order of the candidates never changes.
in case of tie, the first candidate wins.
but there's a gotcha.
sometimes we vote to eliminate a candidate.
the candidate with the most last place votes is eliminated.
in other words, they lose.
in this case, the last candidate "wins" the tie.
when searching for a winner, we take the first candidate with the most votes.
when searching for a loser, we take the last candidate with the most votes.

in the art, the electorate is modeled as voters clustering around positions.
this is usually implemented as the chinese restaurant problem.
there's a dispersion parameter alpha.
N patrons are already seated at tables.
the probability the next patron sits at a table is proportional to how many
patrons are already at the table.
P(patron N+1 sits at table k) = n[k] / (N + alpha)
p(patron N+1 sits by himself) = alpha / (N + alpha)
we place voters this way.
clusters have a position and a standard deviation.
the position ranges from 0.0 to 1.0.
some outstanding questions:
how many clusters do we want?
how does that relate to alpha?

satisfaction is a rather unsatisfying metric.
the best candidate gets a 1.0.
the average candidate gets a 0.0.
what if all candidates are equally good?
if two candidates have equal nearly optimal utility...
and the third has slightly less utility...
then the third candidate has a satisfaction of -2.
even though the third candidate is just as good as the other two.
weird.
what if all candidates are equally horrible?
one of them is going to get satisfaction rating of 1.0.
even though they'd get stomped by a randomly selected voter.
weird.
satisfaction is calculated using maximum and average utility.
i tried using max and average for all voters (expensive),
and all candidates in the primary (not helpful).
so status quo it is.
and more ranting...
when you're doing a summary, the satisfaction isn't to the same scale.
so they can't really be averaged meaningfully.
could try using the worst possible candidate as the baseline.
could try using the median voter/candidate as the baseline.
okay so what we do is this:
average the winner(s), best, and random candidate utilities over all trials.
use the average utilities to compute the satisfaction.
instead of averaging the satisfactions of each trial.

we do not need check independence when multiple candidates drop out.
guthrie does not have satisfy independence from irrelevant alternatives.
the occurance is rare.
but is an opportunity for voters to vote strategically.
specifically B wins.
candidate A prefers B.
but a majority of A's voters prefer C.
if A drops out, or equivalently A's voters defect to C, C may win by majority.

where there are many candidates...
and they form a condorcet ordering...
we have a nash equilibrium.
"proof":
a majority coalition can efficiently eliminate all candidates not in the coalition.
thereby ensuring one of the coalition members wins.
in order to forma a majority coalition of the left (close to position 1)...
the guthrie winner must be included.
otherwise they don't have a majority of the voters.
same for the right.
the guthrie winner is the choice for the eliminated right minority coalition.
a right majority coalition forms that includes the guthrie winner.
all other candidates of the left coalition are eliminated.
okay.
a split coalition includes candidates left and right of the guthrie winner
and excludes the guthrie winner.
non-coalition members are eliminated.
including the guthrie winner.
a new winner is selected from the left (for example).
coalition members from the right get a worse result.
and therefore would not join such a coalition.
qed.
the interesting cases are when there are condorcet cycles.
which require two or more uncorrelated axes for the issues.

"dispersion" moves candidates towards the center.
cause voters are far more radical than the candidates.
looks like this paper:
https://voting-in-the-abstract.medium.com/voter-satisfaction-efficiency-many-many-results-ad66ffa87c9e
scales the candidate standard deviation from 5% to 100% of the voter standard deviation.
i think we can just move the candidates position centerward by same percentages.
realistic numbers range from 34% to 94%.
with maybe a reasonable guess around 75%.
the apparent effect of dispersion is to amplify the difference between electoral methods.

things done:

handle ties.
check if the winner is the condorcet winner if there is one.
report satisfaction (two different ways) and bayer regret.
find the voter that would be the optimal candidate.
check for independence ie the winner should still win if any other candidate drops out.
check if the most satisfactory candidate wins.
they don't. but that's okay.
these are diabolical cases that no voting system can do better. except maybe range voting.
multiple trials with summarized results,
normalize electorate to range from 0.0 to 1.0.
clustered voters,
multiple issue dimensions,
anti-plurality - winner has fewest last place votes.
bucklin - while no greatest majority, accumulate next choice counts.
dispersion
average utilities then calculate satisfactions instead of vice versa.
two round plurality - top 2 pluralities go head to head.
two round approval - top 2 vote getters go head to head.
coombs' method.

things in progress:

things to do:

- non-linear utility or piece-wise linear utility.
- account for candidate quality. this is a random adjustment to utility.
- weight utilities for satisfaction computation.
an election of all near-clones contributes less.
an election with high spread contributes more.
- asymmetric utility we assume U(A,B)=U(B,A) but irl it might not.

voting systems to consider adding:

majority judgement voting - winner has the largest median utility.
star - score candidates 0 to 5.
the winner has one of the top two highest total scores and...
is scored higher than the the other finalist on more ballots.
ranked robin - condorcet but voters can give candidates equal ranking.
instant pairwise elimination ipe - eliminate the condorcet loser each round.
with tie breaker rules. https://electowiki.org/wiki/Instant_Pairwise_Elimination
semi-random voting - pick a ballot at ranodm. presumably this motivates honest voting.
choose a winner by some good method that's subject to strategic voting. run-off between the two.

other voting systems worth mentioning:
smith methods - condorcet completion.
maximal lotteries - condorcet completion.
non-smith condorcet.
star - range plus automatic runoff of the top two.
cumulative voting - split 1.0 votes among candidates.
